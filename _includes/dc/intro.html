  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This workshop will introduce toolsets and teach skills for data organization, cleaning and exploration to life science researchers.Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
  The focus will be on genomic data, however, the skills learned are applicable to all research fields.
